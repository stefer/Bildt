I want to build windows desktop application where a user can

- load a number of images,
- preview them one by one,
- edit a description
- Set the description as image tags, Exif or otherwise
- Export the images with a white frame and the description in the lower part of the white frame

I want it to be in modern C#, Winforms.

Application should be structured as in Onion arcitecture.
